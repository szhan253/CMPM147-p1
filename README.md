# Welcome to the Playground
### Description 
The message might be seen in a two-player puzzle computer game as an introduction that shows the background of the game world. To add the complexity, I used a set called ‘elements’ which is showing what the player can find from the playground by combining the ‘color’, ‘shapes’, and ‘tools’ set to make them as one noun phrases to use in the message directly. 

### Artist Statement
In order to make the message to looks like giving background information about a puzzle game. I changed all the messages shown on the page. Additionally, I make an element that contains a lot of unreal animals’ names to show the game is not happening in the real world. 


#### Note 
There is another contributor to the repository because I was using another person’s computer to do the assignment, and GitHub Desktop did not sign out the other person’s account in the comment area successfully at the beginning.
