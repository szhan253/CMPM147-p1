# Welcome to the Playground

### Artist Statement
I watched a video where two people playing We Were Here Forever, which is a two-player puzzle game. In the game, the players need to cooperate and find clues to solve the puzzle for each other to get out of jail. During that time, there is a song called Welcome to My Playground that comes into my mind also. Thus, I decided to combine those two elements and using as my background story.

#### Note 

There is another contributor to the repository because I was using another person’s computer to do the assignment, and GitHub Desktop did not sign out the other person’s account in the comment area successfully at the beginning.
